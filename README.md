# Stable-Queue-based-networks
This is the course project for MATH5593 Linear Programming at the University of Colorado-Denver, Fall 2019. 

Student contributors: Sajjad Nassirpour and John McFarlane

In this project, We use an LP to stabilizing the Queue-based network and explore a strategy determined by linear programming to stabilize queues in a multicast communication network. The proposed strategy maximizes the communication rate with no loss of packets. We define the constraints in order to have the number of incoming packets less than the number of outcoming packets in every queue.

Our simulations are done in "AMPL" software.
